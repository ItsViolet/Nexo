#### Why you should build your projects with **Nexo**
-   **Blazing fast**: Nexo uses its own caching system that was inspired by NextJS's `.next` cache directory. 
-   **Easy to use**: Nexo is very easy to use due to us providing most of the module needed to write an entire application, we do our best to keep the framework API as easy as possible to use!
-   **Use it everywhere**: Nexo is a full-stack framework, thus, we provide modules for building the server application, plus, support for all client platforms such as desktop, mobile and the web, all with JavaScript/TypeScript!
